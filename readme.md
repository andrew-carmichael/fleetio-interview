## Build Instructions

**Note:** API secrets are not committed to the GitHub repo. You will need to define these yourself in order to build the application.

### 1. Set Your API Secrets

Add the following lines to your `gradle.properties` file or set them as environment variables:

```properties
FLEETIO_ACCOUNT_TOKEN="secret"
FLEETIO_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN="Token secret"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="secret"
```

### 2. Use the correct developer tools

The application was build and tested only with:
- Android Studio Ladybug Feature Drop | 2024.2.2 Patch 1
- Tested with Pixel 9 API 35 emulator

- The detail screen will display a map of the vehicle's last known location if defined. See the Toyota Prius in the demo.
- The user can navigate from the detail screen to a map application.
- UI @Previews exist for most of the UI.
